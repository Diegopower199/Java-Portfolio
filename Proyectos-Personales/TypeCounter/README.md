# Type Counter

Identify the different data types present in an input string and report their counts. Each of the substrings, separated by one or more spaces, is one of either the String, Integer, or Double type. Print the results on 3 lines in the order shown in the example. If a type does not occur, report that type with a count of 0.

**Example**
```
sentence = "can you give me 10 bucks puff in 7.5 or 7"

The output is:
String 8
Integer 2
Double 1
```
